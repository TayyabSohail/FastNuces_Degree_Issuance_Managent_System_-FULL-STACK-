# Problem Statement:
The problem of inefficient management and processing of degree issuance requests within the One
Stop Services Centre affects the timely delivery of academic credentials to students, the impact of
which is delayed graduation processes, frustrated students, and administrative bottlenecks.
A successful solution would be the development and implementation of an online web-based
system specifically tailored to the degree issuance module within the One Stop Services Centre.
This system should enable students to generate queries regarding their degree issuance concerns
and facilitate seamless communication between students and One Stop Team members. By
focusing on automating tracking systems, implementing notification mechanisms, and optimizing
processing workflows, the solution aims to streamline the degree issuance process, ensuring
prompt delivery of degrees and transcripts to students while minimizing administrative burden and
enhancing overall student satisfaction.
